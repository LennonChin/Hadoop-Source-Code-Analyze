<ul>

<li> <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-7728">HADOOP-7728</a>.
     Major bug reported by rramya and fixed by rramya (conf)<br>
     <b>hadoop-setup-conf.sh should be modified to enable task memory manager</b><br>
     <blockquote>                                              Enable task memory management to be configurable via hadoop config setup script.

<li> <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-7740">HADOOP-7740</a>.
     Minor bug reported by arpitgupta and fixed by arpitgupta (conf)<br>
     <b>security audit logger is not on by default, fix the log4j properties to enable the logger</b><br>
     <blockquote>                                              Fixed security audit logger configuration. (Arpit Gupta via Eric Yang)

<li> <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-617">HDFS-617</a>.
     Major improvement reported by kzhang and fixed by kzhang (hdfs client, name-node)<br>
     <b>Support for non-recursive create() in HDFS</b><br>
     <blockquote>                                              New DFSClient.create(...) allows option of not creating missing parent(s).

      
</blockquote></li>

<li> <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-2246">HDFS-2246</a>.
     Major improvement reported by sanjay.radia and fixed by jnp <br>
     <b>Shortcut a local client reads to a Datanodes files directly</b><br>
     <blockquote>                    1. New configurations<br/>

a. dfs.block.local-path-access.user is the key in datanode configuration to specify the user allowed to do short circuit read.<br/>

b. dfs.client.read.shortcircuit is the key to enable short circuit read at the client side configuration.<br/>

c. dfs.client.read.shortcircuit.skip.checksum is the key to bypass checksum check at the client side.<br/>

2. By default none of the above are enabled and short circuit read will not kick in.<br/>

3. If security is on, the feature can be used only for user that has kerberos credentials at the client, therefore map reduce tasks cannot benefit from it in general.<br/>

<li> <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-2316">HDFS-2316</a>.
     Major new feature reported by szetszwo and fixed by szetszwo <br>
     <b>[umbrella] webhdfs: a complete FileSystem implementation for accessing HDFS over HTTP</b><br>
     <blockquote>                    Provide webhdfs as a complete FileSystem implementation for accessing HDFS over HTTP.<br/>

Previous hftp feature was a read-only FileSystem and does not provide &quot;write&quot; accesses.

<li> <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-5124">HADOOP-5124</a>.
     Major improvement reported by hairong and fixed by hairong <br>
     <b>A few optimizations to FsNamesystem#RecentInvalidateSets</b><br>
     <blockquote>This jira proposes a few optimization to FsNamesystem#RecentInvalidateSets:<br>1. when removing all replicas of a block, it does not traverse all nodes in the map. Instead it traverse only the nodes that the block is located.<br>2. When dispatching blocks to datanodes in ReplicationMonitor. It randomly chooses a predefined number of datanodes and dispatches blocks to those datanodes. This strategy provides fairness to all datanodes. The current strategy always starts from the first datanode.</blockquote></li>

<li> <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-6840">HADOOP-6840</a>.
     Minor improvement reported by nspiegelberg and fixed by jnp (fs, io)<br>
     <b>Support non-recursive create() in FileSystem &amp; SequenceFile.Writer</b><br>
     <blockquote>The proposed solution for HBASE-2312 requires the sequence file to handle a non-recursive create.  This is already supported by HDFS, but needs to have an equivalent FileSystem &amp; SequenceFile.Writer API.</blockquote></li>

<li> <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-6886">HADOOP-6886</a>.
     Minor improvement reported by nspiegelberg and fixed by  (fs)<br>
     <b>LocalFileSystem Needs createNonRecursive API</b><br>
     <blockquote>While running sanity check tests for HBASE-2312, I noticed that HDFS-617 did not include createNonRecursive() support for the LocalFileSystem.  This is a problem for HBase, which allows the user to run over the LocalFS instead of HDFS for local cluster testing.  I think this only affects 0.20-append, but may affect the trunk based upon how exactly FileContext handles non-recursive creates.</blockquote></li>

     <blockquote>When packaging is invoked as &quot;ant clean tar deb&quot;.  The system creates both system layout and tarball layout in the same build directory.  Debian packaging target would pick up files for both layouts.  The end result of using produced debian package built this way, would end up README.txt LICENSE.txt, and jar files in /usr.</blockquote></li>

     <b>Heartbeats times from Datanodes increase when there are plenty of blocks to delete</b><br>
     <blockquote>I am seeing that when we delete a large directory that has plenty of blocks, the heartbeat times from datanodes increase significantly from the normal value of 3 seconds to as large as 50 seconds or so. The heartbeat thread in the Datanode deletes a bunch of blocks sequentially, this causes the heartbeat times to increase.</blockquote></li>

     <b>Race condition on FSNamesystem#recentInvalidateSets introduced by HADOOP-5124</b><br>
     <blockquote>HADOOP-5124 provided some improvements to FSNamesystem#recentInvalidateSets. But it introduced unprotected access to the data structure recentInvalidateSets. Specifically, FSNamesystem.computeInvalidateWork accesses recentInvalidateSets without read-lock protection. If there is concurrent activity (like reducing replication on a file) that adds to recentInvalidateSets, the name-node crashes with a ConcurrentModificationException.</blockquote></li>

     <b>Make RPC to have an option to timeout</b><br>

This works great if the RPC server is NameNode.<br><br>But Hadoop RPC is also used for some of client to DataNode communications, for e...</blockquote></li>

     <b>TaskTracker should handle disk failures at both startup and runtime</b><br>
     <blockquote>At present, TaskTracker doesn&apos;t handle disk failures properly both at startup and runtime.<br><br>(1) Currently TaskTracker doesn&apos;t come up if any of the mapred-local-dirs is on a bad disk. TaskTracker should ignore that particular mapred-local-dir and start up and use only the remaining good mapred-local-dirs.<br>(2) If a disk goes bad while TaskTracker is running, currently TaskTracker doesn&apos;t do anything special. This results in either<br>   (a) TaskTracker continues to &quot;try to use that bad disk&quot; and this results in lots of task failures and possibly job failures(because of multiple TTs having bad disks) and eventually these TTs getting graylisted for all jobs. And this needs manual restart of TT with modified configuration of mapred-local-dirs avoiding the bad disk. OR<br>   (b) Health check script identifying the disk as bad and the TT gets blacklisted. And this also needs manual restart of TT with modified configuration of mapred-local-dirs avoiding the bad disk.<br><br>This JIRA is to make TaskTracker more fault-tolerant to disk failures solving (1) and (2). i.e. TT should start even if at least one of the mapred-local-dirs is on a good disk and TT should adjust its in-memory list of mapred-local-dirs and avoid using bad mapred-local-dirs.<br></blockquote></li>

For example, if a particular datanode ends up randomly selecting 18 minutes after the hour, then that datanode will send a Block Report at 18 minutes after the hour every hour as long as it remains up.  Other datanodes will start their cycles at other randomly selected times.  This code is in DataNode.blockReport() and DataNode.scheduleBlockReport().<br><br>The &quot;second Block Report&quot; (2BR), is the start of these hourly reports.  The problem is that some of these 2BRs get scheduled sooner rather than later, and actually occur within the startup period.  For example, if the cluster takes 40 minutes (2/3 of an hour) to start up, then out of the datanodes that succeed in sending their IBRs during the first 10 minutes, between 1/2 and 2/3 of them will send their 2BR before the 40-minute startup time has completed!<br><br>2BRs sent within the startup time actually compete with the remaining IBRs, and thereby slow down the overall startup process.  This can be seen in the following data, which shows the startup process for a 3700-node cluster that took about 17 minutes to finish startup:<br><br>{noformat}<br>      time    starts  sum   regs  sum   IBR  sum  2nd_BR sum total_BRs/min<br>0   1299799498  3042  3042  1969  1969  151   151          0  151<br>1   1299799558   665  3707  1470  3439  248   399          0  248<br>2   1299799618        3707   224  3663  270   669          0  270<br>3   1299799678        3707    14  3677  261   930    3     3  264<br>4   1299799738        3707    23  3700  288  1218    1     4  289<br>5   1299799798        3707     7  3707  258  1476    3     7  261<br>6   1299799858        3707        3707  317  1793    4    11  321<br>7   1299799918        3707        3707  292  2085    6    17  298<br>8   1299799978        3707        3707  292  2377    8    25  300<br>9   1299800038        3707        3707  272  2649         25  272<br>10  1299800098        3707        3707  280  2929   15    40  295<br>11  1299800158        3707        3707  223  3152   14    54  237<br>12  1299800218        3707        3707  143  3295         54  143<br>13  1299800278        3707        3707  141  3436   20    74  161<br>14  1299800338        3707        3707  195  3631   78   152  273<br>15  1299800398        3707        3707   51  3682  209   361  260<br>16  1299800458        3707        3707   25  3707  369   730  394<br>17  1299800518        3707        3707       3707  166   896  166<br>18  1299800578        3707        3707       3707   72   968   72<br>19  1299800638        3707        3707       3707   67  1035   67<br>20  1299800698        3707        3707       3707   75  1110   75<br>21  1299800758        3707        3707       3707   71  1181   71<br>22  1299800818        3707        3707       3707   67  1248   67<br>23  1299800878        3707        3707       3707   62  1310   62<br>24  1299800938        3707        3707       3707   56  1366   56<br>25  1299800998        3707        3707       3707   60  1426   60<br>{noformat}<br><br>This data was harvested from the startup logs of all the datanodes, and correlated into one-minute buckets.

The IBR column shows a sustained rate of Initial Block Report processing of 250-300/minute for the first 10 minutes.<br><br>The question is why, during minutes 11 through 16, the rate of IBR processing slowed down.  Why didn&apos;t the startup just finish?  In the &quot;2nd_BR&quot; column, we see the rate of 2BRs ramping up as more datanodes complete their IBRs.  As the rate increases, they become more effective at competing with the IBRs, and slow down the IBR processing even more.  After the IBRs finally finish in minute 16, the rate of 2BRs settles down to a steady ~60-70/minute.<br><br>In order to decrease competition for locks and other resources, to speed up IBR processing during startup, we propose to delay 2BRs until later into the cycle.</blockquote></li>

     Minor bug reported by tanping and fixed by tanping (tools)<br>
     <b>Web UI JSP pages thread safety issue</b><br>
     <blockquote>The set of JSP pages that web UI uses are not thread safe.  We have observed some problems when requesting Live/Dead/Decommissioning pages from the web UI, incorrect page is displayed.  To be more specific, requesting Dead node list page, sometimes, Live node page is returned.  Requesting decommissioning page, sometimes, dead page is returned.<br><br>The root cause of this problem is that JSP page is not thread safe by default.  When multiple requests come in,  each request is assigned to a different thread, multiple threads access the same instance of the servlet class resulted from a JSP page.  A class variable is shared by multiple threads.  The JSP code in 20 branche, for example, dfsnodelist.jsp has<br>{code}<br>&lt;!%<br>  int rowNum = 0;<br>  int colNum = 0;<br>  String sorterField = null;<br>  String sorterOrder = null;<br>  String whatNodes = &quot;LIVE&quot;;<br>  ...<br>%&gt;<br>{code}<br><br>declared as  class variables.  ( These set of variables are declared within &lt;%! code %&gt; directives which made them class members. )  Multiple threads share the same set of class member variables, one request would step on anther&apos;s toe. <br><br>However, due to the JSP code refactor, HADOOP-5857, all of these class member variables are moved to become function local variables.  So this bug does not appear in Apache trunk.  Hence, we have proposed to take a simple fix for this bug on 20 branch alone, to be more specific, branch-0.20-security.<br><br>The simple fix is to add jsp ThreadSafe=&quot;false&quot; directive into the related JSP pages, dfshealth.jsp and dfsnodelist.jsp to make them thread safe, i.e. only on request is processed at each time. <br><br>We did evaluate the thread safety issue for other JSP pages on trunk, we noticed a potential problem is that when we retrieving some statistics from namenode, for example, we make the call to <br>{code}<br>NamenodeJspHelper.getInodeLimitText(fsn);<br>{code}<br>in dfshealth.jsp, which eventuality is <br><br>{code}<br>  static String getInodeLimitText(FSNamesystem fsn) {<br>    long inodes = fsn.dir.totalInodes();<br>    long blocks = fsn.getBlocksTotal();<br>    long maxobjects = fsn.getMaxObjects();<br>    ....<br>{code}<br><br>some of the function calls are already guarded by readwritelock, e.g. dir.totalInodes, but others are not.  As a result of this, the web ui results are not 100% thread safe.  But after evaluating the prons and cons of adding a giant lock into the JSP pages, we decided not to issue FSNamesystem ReadWrite locks into JSPs.<br><br></blockquote></li>

     <b>Quota bug for partial blocks allows quotas to be violated </b><br>
     <blockquote>There&apos;s a bug in the quota code that causes them not to be respected when a file is not an exact multiple of the block size. Here&apos;s an example:<br><br>{code}<br>$ hadoop fs -mkdir /test<br>$ hadoop dfsadmin -setSpaceQuota 384M /test<br>$ ls dir/ | wc -l   # dir contains 101 files<br>101<br>$ du -ms dir        # each is 3mb<br>304	dir<br>$ hadoop fs -put dir /test<br>$ hadoop fs -count -q /test<br>        none             inf       402653184      -550502400            2          101          317718528 hdfs://haus01.sf.cloudera.com:10020/test<br>$ hadoop fs -stat &quot;%o %r&quot; /test/dir/f30<br>134217728 3    # three 128mb blocks<br>{code}<br><br>INodeDirectoryWithQuota caches the number of bytes consumed by it&apos;s children in {{diskspace}}. The quota adjustment code has a bug that causes {{diskspace}} to get updated incorrectly when a file is not an exact multiple of the block size (the value ends up being negative). <br><br>This causes the quota checking code to think that the files in the directory consumes less space than they actually do, so the verifyQuota does not throw a QuotaExceededException even when the directory is over quota. However the bug isn&apos;t visible to users because {{fs count -q}} reports the numbers generated by INode#getContentSummary which adds up the sizes of the blocks rather than use the cached INodeDirectoryWithQuota#diskspace value.<br><br>In FSDirectory#addBlock the disk space consumed is set conservatively to the full block size * the number of replicas:<br><br>{code}<br>updateCount(inodes, inodes.length-1, 0,<br>    fileNode.getPreferredBlockSize()*fileNode.getReplication(), true);<br>{code}<br><br>In FSNameSystem#addStoredBlock we adjust for this conservative estimate by subtracting out the difference between the conservative estimate and what the number of bytes actually stored was:<br><br>{code}<br>//Updated space consumed if required.<br>INodeFile file = (storedBlock != null) ? storedBlock.getINode() : null;<br>long diff = (file == null) ? 0 :<br>    (file.getPreferredBlockSize() - storedBlock.getNumBytes());<br><br>if (diff &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; file.isUnderConstruction() &amp;&amp;<br>    cursize &lt; storedBlock.getNumBytes()) {<br>...<br>    dir.updateSpaceConsumed(path, 0, -diff*file.getReplication());<br>{code}<br><br>We do the same in FSDirectory#replaceNode when completing the file, but at a file granularity (I believe the intent here is to correct for the cases when there&apos;s a failure replicating blocks and recovery). Since oldnode is under construction INodeFile#diskspaceConsumed will use the preferred block size  (vs of Block#getNumBytes used by newnode) so we will again subtract out the difference between the full block size and what the number of bytes actually stored was:<br><br>{code}<br>long dsOld = oldnode.diskspaceConsumed();<br>...<br>//check if disk space needs to be updated.<br>long dsNew = 0;<br>if (updateDiskspace &amp;&amp; (dsNew = newnode.diskspaceConsumed()) != dsOld) {<br>  try {<br>    updateSpaceConsumed(path, 0, dsNew-dsOld);<br>...<br>{code}<br><br>So in the above example we started with diskspace at 384mb (3 * 128mb) and then we subtract 375mb (to reflect only 9mb raw was actually used) twice so for each file the diskspace for the directory is - 366mb (384mb minus 2 * 375mb). Which is why the quota gets negative and yet we can still write more files.<br><br>So a directory with lots of single block files (if you have multiple blocks on the final partial block ends up subtracting from the diskspace used) ends up having a quota that&apos;s way off.<br><br>I think the fix is to in FSDirectory#replaceNode not have the diskspaceConsumed calculations differ when the old and new INode have the same blocks. I&apos;ll work on a patch which also adds a quota test for blocks that are not multiples of the block size and warns in INodeDirectory#computeContentSummary if the computed size does not reflect the cached value.</blockquote></li>

    that currently there is no easy way to know if the user has access
    to submit jobs to a queue, until it fails with an access control
    exception.
